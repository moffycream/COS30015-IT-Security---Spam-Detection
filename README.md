This project is based on the “Attacker or Malware Analysis” track and specifically addresses Scenario 1: “Using scripts and web services, trace (over 50) spam e-mails to their source as best as you can, try to detect them.” By combining machine learning with spam source tracing and content analysis, this project provides insights from both attacker and defender perspectives. It demonstrates how spam emails can be identified and broken down into scam types, languages, and tactics, helping to reveal the strategies used to evade detection. This is especially important as modern phishing emails are increasingly difficult to detect using rule-based filters alone.
